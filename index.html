				<p> Experimental digital art is what I call one of my hobbies. But what do I mean by that? Well, it's about altering 
			 diverse digital material (such as photographs or former created patterns) in various experimental ways like filtering, extracting, adding, recolouring 
			 or turning - and on the other side on creating something from scratch by using a digital tablet and combining areas, lines and layers.
