				<p> Creating experimental digital art is so much fun because it is so simple and you can get wonderful results with only doing some clicks. There are endless possibilities
			what you can change and how you can change it. Sometimes it is just a change of colours, sometimes you extract some parts and melt them together with parts of another basic piece
			(like a photo or picture). You will always be suprised how your creation generates a completely other feeling by just altering one small part. And you do not need to colour areas
			exhaustingly with your hand. Just click and see the result!
